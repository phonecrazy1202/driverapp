# Android app for realtime driver status system

## Working:

Cab drivers can register and login easily thanks to the flexible UI of the app. 
Once logged in, they can update their status from available to not available at a finger's click. Best part? Gets updated on the main dashboard in realtime!

## Running:

If you want to run the app in your local system,

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/phonecrazy1202/driverapp.git`
2. Import the app into Android Studio - File->Import existing project
3. Run the app and use your phone as the USB device to debug your app

PRs are welcome! :)
